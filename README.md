# LocaltoGlobalCPI

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model to predict interactions between chemicals and proteins. 
The model processes both local and global features of compounds and proteins using specialized neural network architectures. 
The implementation is carried out using the PyTorch framework.

## Features of the Model
Multi-head Architecture: The model employs four distinct heads to process:
- Local features of compounds.
- Global features of compounds.
- Local features of proteins.
- Global features of proteins.
